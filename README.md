## Abstract
This paper introduces a novel approach for high-quality deepfake detection called Localized Artifact Attention Network (LAA-Net).  Existing methods for high-quality deepfake detection are mainly based on a supervised binary classifier coupled with an implicit attention mechanism. As a result, they do not generalize well to unseen manipulations. To handle this issue, two main contributions are made. First, an explicit attention mechanism within a multi-task learning framework is proposed. By combining heatmap-based and self-consistency attention strategies, LAA-Net is forced to focus on a few small artifact-prone regions. Second, an Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (E-FPN) is suggested as a simple and effective mechanism for spreading discriminative low-level features into the final feature output, with the advantage of limiting redundancy. Experiments performed on several benchmarks show the superiority of our approach in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Average Precision (AP).

## Docker Build (Optional)
*We further provide an optional Docker file that can be used to build a working env with Docker. More detailed steps can be found [here](dockerfiles/README.md).*

1.  Install docker to the system (postpone this step if docker has already been installed):
    ```shell
    sudo apt install docker
    ```
2. To start your docker environment go to the folder *dockerfiles*:
   ```shell
   cd dockerfiles
   ```
3. Create a docker image (you can put any name you want):
    ```shell
    docker build --tag 'laa_net' .
    ```


## Quickstart
1. **Preparation**

    1. ***Prepare environment***

        Installing main packages as the recommended environment.
    
    2. ***Prepare dataset***
        
        1. Downloading [FF++](https://github.com/ondyari/FaceForensics) *Original* dataset for training data preparation. Following the original split convention, it is firstly used to randomly extract frames and facial crops:
            ```
            python package_utils/images_crop.py -d {dataset} \
            -c {compression} \
            -n {num_frames} \
            -t {task}
            ```
            (*This script can also be utilized for cropping faces in other datasets such as [CDF](https://github.com/yuezunli/celeb-deepfakeforensics), [DFD](https://blog.research.google/2019/09/contributing-data-to-deepfake-detection.html), [DFDC](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/dfdc/) for cross-evaluation test. You do not need to run crop for [DFW](https://github.com/deepfakeinthewild/deepfake-in-the-wild) as the data is already preprocessed*).
            
            | Parameter | Value | Definition  |
            | --- | --- | --- |
            | -d | Subfolder in each dataset. For example: *['Face2Face','Deepfakes','FaceSwap','NeuralTextures', ...]*| You can use one of those datasets.|
            | -c | *['raw','c23','c40']*| You can use one of those compressions|
            | -n | *128*  | Number of frames (*default* 32 for val/test and 128 for train) |
            | -t | *['train', 'val', 'test']* | Default train|
            
            These faces cropped are saved for online pseudo-fake generation in the training process, following the data structure below:
            
            ```

            ```
        
        2. Downloading **Dlib** [[68]](https://github.com/davisking/dlib-models) [[81]](https://github.com/codeniko/shape_predictor_81_face_landmarks) facial landmarks detector pretrained and place into ```/pretrained/```. whereas the *68* and *81* will be used for the *BI* and *SBI* synthesis, respectively.

        3. Landmarks detection and alignment. At the same time, a folder for aligned images (```aligned```) is automatically created with the same directory tree as the original one. After completing the script running, a file that stores metadata information of the data is saved at ```processed_data/c0/{SPLIT}_<n_landmarks>_FF++_processed.json```.
            ```
            python package_utils/geo_landmarks_extraction.py \
            --config configs/data_preprocessing_c0.yaml \
            --extract_landmarks \
            --save_aligned
            ```
        4. (Optional) Finally, if using BI synthesis, for the online pseudo-fake generation scheme, 30 similar landmarks are searched for each facial query image beforehand.
            ```
            python package_utils/bi_online_generation.py \
            -t search_similar_lms \
            -f processed_data/c0/{SPLIT}_68_FF++_processed.json 
            ```
            
            *The final annotation file for training is created as* ```processed_data/c0/dynamic_{SPLIT}BI_FF.json```
        
2. **Training script**

    We offer a number of config files for specific data synthesis. 
    With *BI*, open ```configs/efn4_fpn_hm_adv.yaml```, please make sure you set ```TRAIN: True``` and ```FROM_FILE: True``` and run:
    ```
    ./scripts/train_efn_adv.sh
    ```

    Otherwise, with *SBI*, with the config file ```configs/efn4_fpn_sbi_adv.yaml```:
    ```
    ./scripts/efn_sbi.sh
    ```

3. **Testing script**

    For *BI*, open ```configs/efn4_fpn_hm_adv.yaml```, with ```subtask: eval``` in the *test* section, we support evaluation mode, please turn off ```TRAIN: False``` and ```FROM_FILE: False``` and run:
    ```
    ./scripts/test_efn.sh
    ```
    Otherwise, for *SBI*
    ```
    ./scripts/test_sbi.sh
    ```
    > ⚠️ *Please make sure you set the correct path to your download pre-trained weights in the config files.*

    > ℹ️ *Flip test can be used by setting ```flip_test: True```*
    
    > ℹ️ *The mode for single image inference is also provided, please set ```sub_task: test_image``` and pass an image path as an argument in test.py*
